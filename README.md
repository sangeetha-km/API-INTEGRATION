#This project is a full-stack web application that displays real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. It is developed using ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

The backend is built with C# in ASP.NET Core, where it exposes a RESTful API endpoint. When the user inputs a city name on the webpage, the backend uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The server then sends this data back to the frontend in JSON format.

The frontend provides a clean and responsive user interface. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle user input and fetch data asynchronously from the backend using the fetch() API. This allows the page to update weather information without reloading.

The app includes basic error handling, such as displaying messages when an invalid city is entered or the API fails to respond. This project demonstrates core full-stack development skills like REST API creation, external API integration, asynchronous data handling, and responsive UI design.

It serves as a simple but effective example of real-world API integration in web development.#
